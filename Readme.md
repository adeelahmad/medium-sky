# Analyze your Medium.com articles with Knowledge Graphs and NLP with Medium-Sky

Medium-Sky is a simple open source Python-HTML app that allows you to explore a Medium.com profile
by analyzing the content of each article, as well as the relationship between the articles and
their referenced external website domains (Medium API, Knowledge Graphs, basic NLP techniques and ChatGPT).

[barackobama v2 - isolated](https://storage.googleapis.com/medium-sky/barackobama_i.html) <br>

## How to Use

To use, you need to do the following actions:
1) Clone GitHub repo. <br>
    `git clone https://github.com/justdataplease/medium-sky.git`
2) To download Medium articles, subscribe to medium.com api [Rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/nishujain199719-vgIfuFHZxVZ/api/medium2) (you
   get 150 requests per month for free - if you want to analyze all your articles, this app will work for free if you
   have less than 148 articles).
3) [OPTIONAL] To calculate ChatGpt metrics you need to have an account at [Openai](https://platform.openai.com).
4) Copy paste .env_sample to .env and paste you X-RapidAPI-Key that you will
   find [here](https://rapidapi.com/nishujain199719-vgIfuFHZxVZ/api/medium2) and [OPTIONAL] Openai api key that you will find [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
5) Install requirements. <br>
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6) To get all the articles (without ChatGPT integration) run: <br>
   `python kgraph -u=<username>` <br>
   <br>
   To get the last 10 of your most recent articles run: <br>
   `python kgraph -u=<username> -l=10` <br>
   <br>
   To get an isolated knowledge graph (version 2 - Look Documentation), run: <br>
   `python kgraph -u=<username> -l=10 -i`

   <br>
   
   To use ChatGpt to get summary and keywords metrics (Look Documentation), run: <br>
   `python kgraph -u=<username> -l=10 -ai`

7) Find the generated HTML in the output folder
   <username>_m.html (mixed or version 1)
   <username>_i.html (-i : isolated or version 2)

### Important

On the 1st run of step 4. the Medium API will be used and the data will be saved to a <username>_<number_of_articles>
.pickle file.
If you rerun without changing the -l parameter (--limit) then the local picle file will be used and not Medium API. <br>
To test this case you can run the following file to generate output for sample users (Local *.picle files will be used):
    `python run_sample_users.py`
[OPTIONAL] On every run it will check if we got a response from Openai API for a specific article. If we do not have the response
Openai API will be used and the response will be saved to a <username>_openai_repsonses.csv file. If we have a response,
then the local file will be used and not Openai API.

## Metrics Documentation

### Knowledge Graph

A Knowledge graph is a diagram that shows how different elements (nodes) are related to each other by using lines (edges).
In this network graph, we have two types of nodes and one type of edge:

- Star (node) : This represents the main article. The larger the star, the greater the number of voters the article had.
  Voters are defined as unique users that clapped or unique claps.
- Dot or Circle (node) : This represents the external website domain. The larger the dot, the more frequently this
  domain appeared. Next to domain name there is a number that shows how many times this domain appeared. In version 1 frequency refers to unique references in main articles and in version 2 frequency refers to the number of references in an article.
- Edge (link) - These are the bidirectional links between the stars and dots.

This app provides 2 versions of Network Graphs:

1. Isolated (with the -i argument): This version focuses on the connections between main articles. It also allows us to
   inspect the external website domains that are referenced in each article. The same external website domain may appear
   multiple times in different articles.
2. Mixed (without the -i argument): This version shows the connections between both main articles and external website
   domains. Each external website domain appears only once, allowing us to see the most frequently used domains and how
   they are connected to all the articles.

### Profile Section

The Profile section, is the area on the right navigation bar that shows user metrics. This is visible when the app is
first opened.

- **Articles [Number]** : Number of articles that were used for the analysis (not the total number of articles of a
  user). Next to articles, there is also the total numbers of words.
  To find the total number of words we exclude english stopwords (based on [NTLK](https://www.nltk.org/) package) and
  words less than 3 characters.
- **Top article [String]** : Top article is the article with the maximum number of Voters. Voters are defined as unique
  users that clapped or unique claps.
- **Publications [List]** : This is a frequency list of the articles based on their publication. If there is no
  publication the name 'Medium' is used. The format is \<publication\> \(\<articles published\>\)
- **Voters - Followers % (Article AVG) [Number]** : This is the average of the Voters / Followers per article. For an
  article, Voters are defined as unique users that clapped or unique claps. Followers is the actual number of followers
  at a specific time.
- **Claps per Person (Article AVG) [Number]** : This is the average of Claps / Voters per article. For an article,
  Voters are defined as unique users that clapped or unique claps.
- **Preferred Published Time [List]** : This is a frequency list of the preferred publishing time period. This refers to
  a time period (24h time cluster) inside a day, using the following rules
  [00:00 and 05:00) : "night", "early" <br>
  [05:00 and 08:00) : "night", "late" <br>
  [08:00 and 12:00) : "morning", "morning" <br>
  [12:00 and 15:00) : "afternoon", "early" <br>
  [15:00 and 18:00) : "afternoon", "late" <br>
  [18:00 and 21:00) : "evening", "early" <br>
  [21:00 and 00:00) : "evening", "late" <br>
- **Preferred Article Length (stemmed) [Number]** : This is a frequency list of the article words length. To find the
  total number of words we exclude english stopwords (based on NTLK package) and words less than 3 characters. This is a
  cluster that is calculated using the total number of words as follows:
  words < 100 : "very short" <br>
  words < 300 : "short" <br>
  words < 500 : "normal" <br>
  words < 500 : "medium" <br>
  words < 1800 : "large" <br>
  words > 1800 : "very large" <br>

- **Published Frequency (AVG) [Number]** : This is the average of the difference in days, between the published dates of
  2 consecutive articles. Next to this metric there is also the start date and the end date of the analysis.
- **Last Seen [Number]** : This the difference in days, between today and the maximum published date.
- **External Domains per Article [Number]** : For each article we calculate the number of unique domains (unique per
  article) that are referenced in it. Then, we find external domains for the user by summing up external domains per
  article. Finally, we divide external domains for the user with the number of the articles (not total articles of the
  user).
- **Stemmed words / words [Number]** : This refers to the number of words if we exclude english stop words and words
  with less than 3 characters. Then we divide with the total number of words.
- **Unique words / words [Number]** : This refers to the unique number of words divided by the total number of words.
- **Unique words / words (stemmed) [Number]** : This refers to the unique number of words, after using Porter Stemming,
  if we exclude english stopwords and words with less than 3 characters, divided by the number of words if we exclude
  english stopwords and words with less than 3 characters.
- **Verb / words [Number]** : Using NLTK pos_tagger, this the percentage of (recognised) verbs in the text.
- **Adj / words [Number]** : Using NLTK pos_tagger, this the percentage of (recognised) adjectives in the text.
- **Noun / words [Number]** : Using NLTK pos_tagger, this the percentage of (recognised) nouns in the text.
- **Most Common Words [List]** : This is a frequency list of the most common words after using Porter Stemming (as a

- **Most Common ChatGPT Words (UPA) [List]** : Most common words based on ChatGPT keyword extraction prompt. UPA stands for Unique Per Article.
- **Most Common Words (UPA) [List]** : Look at Most Common Words. UPA stands for Unique Per Article. This means that if
  a word is mentioned more than once in an article it will not count. The maximum frequency equals to the number of
  articles of the analysis.
- **Most Common Bigrams (UPA) [List]** : Look at Most Common Bigrams. UPA stands for Unique Per Article. This means that
  if a word is mentioned more than once in an article it will not count. The maximum frequency equals to the number of
