SUMMARY=This article analyzes publicly available datasets to understand factors beyond dog intelligence that play a role in a breed category's obedience training. The analysis found that dog weight, breed category, and height were critical factors in predicting the percentage of dogs that obeyed the first command. Using a machine learning model, particularly the CatBoostRegressor, the author validated that the obedience score percentage could be predicted with a 41.87% RMSE improvement from the baseline model. Finally, using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method, the author discovered that dog weight and breed category are the most critical features in predicting obeying a command. It was surprisingly found that herding dog breeds were the most obedient, while weight and the number of required repetitions were negatively correlated.
