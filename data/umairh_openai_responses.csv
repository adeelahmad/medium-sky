People are experiencing extreme heatwaves, animals are dying, and the streets are lined with dead things. The author suggests that humanity is crossing a threshold of survivability and that a cataclysmic extinction event is happening. Even with the drastic changes, some people remain in denial or are too busy with daily life to see the crisis. The author argues that the current use of the term ""climate change"" is inadequate in describing the situation. It is a mass extinction event that is visible and happening right now.

SUMMARY: The text discusses the concept of polycrisis and how it is a reflection of the 21st century. It highlights the various crises faced by societies around the world, including financial instability, social unrest, political turmoil, climate change, and more. The author uses a comparison between a little town and an exurb to demonstrate how societal divisions and a lack of investment in public goods and services can exacerbate these crises.

86403169e902	"SUMMARY: The article discusses the connection between climate change and the financial system, arguing that the intensifying crisis in various systems (food, water, energy, healthcare) will inevitably lead to another banking crisis. The author emphasizes that investment banks should invest in systems and institutions that support infrastructure resilience and reliable power systems. Instead, they are investing in industrial age systems that are becoming outdated and contribute to civilizational and climate risk. The author suggests that investment in green agriculture, clean energy, and closed-loop manufacturing is a better alternative for long-term investment. The constant profiting and profiteering from this outdated system is contributing to the eventual collapse of the system and is a recipe for risk.

SUMMARY: The author discusses the current state of the global economy, highlighting how economies are trapped in a doom loop, with central banks hammering interest rates every month to try and stop skyrocketing inflation. However, this approach is not working, and there is proof that inflation is still soaring. The author argues that the distinction between supply and demand-led inflation is no longer true since we are facing a supply-driven inflation crisis due to climate change, and the world is facing a polycrisis that is exacerbating the problem. The current approach to managing economies is counterproductive, and the author suggests that we need to take a hard look at our institutions and approach to investing if we want to avoid a collapse of civilization.

SUMMARY= This text discusses the unconscionable way in which America treats its elderly and the crisis of elderly care in the country. The author notes that the issue is of grave proportions and barely makes sense to people in the rest of the world who view it as a scandalous failure of the system. Elderly care in America is depicted as a corrupt and exploitative institution where individuals are degraded, abused, and dehumanized, with no prospects of receiving quality care. The author suggests that the root cause of the problem is the lack of basic public goods, systems, and institutions that are taken for granted in the rest of the rich world. They highlight the need to build insurance programs that pay for long-term care and spread the financial burden across everyone."

SUMMARY: The text discusses the concept of a moral gift that is essential for civilization to survive and thrive in the 21st century, in the face of climate change and other challenges.

SUMMARY=The text argues that authoritarianism and fascism are slowly breaking democracy by attacking institutions and using language that distorts truth and creates room for big lies. The example of the BBC's forced step on Gary Lineker, who stated a fact about the government's rhetoric on refugees, shows how impartiality in institutions can become an absurd rule that prioritizes opinions over facts. The text warns that, in the face of the natural pull towards power and degradation of institutions, it is important to defend democratic values of truth, freedom, equality, and justice, and resist bigotry, hate, and oppression. The author invokes the teachings of Orwell on the dangers of language games and institutional perversion, drawing on Animal Farm and 1984 to stress the need for vigilance and resistance. The text concludes by calling attention to the ugliness and deformation of democracy in contemporary times and the importance of learning from history."

SUMMARY= The text discusses the re-emergence of fascism in the form of conservatism becoming fascism, particularly in Florida where a Republican legislator has introduced a bill that would require bloggers to register with the state if they criticize politicians. The author argues that the neoconservative movement, which famously sought to ""drown government in a bathtub"", has helped to pave the way for the current trend of expanding government to eviscerate the rights of hated groups and institutionalize hate. The author suggests that conservatism should be about preserving and nurturing social bonds and protecting basic human rights, and that the current trend of limiting government to the bare minimum has resulted in Americans living shorter, unhealthier, unhappier lives than their counterparts in other rich nations.
