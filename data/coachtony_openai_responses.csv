SUMMARY=Medium has announced a new feature called Boost, which will allow authors to give their stories a higher chance of being seen by readers.

While publication editors and the Medium internal curation team are responsible for suggesting stories for boost, the goal is to work with community curators to maintain high standards for the boosted stories. The Boost feature is currently in a soft launch phase, and the goal is to give every boosted story a minimum of 500 extra views within the first week."

SUMMARY=Medium is launching a Mastodon instance in order to help authors and publications find a new home within the Fediverse. While Medium was originally focused on article-length writing, Mastodon is primarily used for short-form writing of 500 characters or less. However, Mastodon also brings important innovations around the concept of federation, which is a form of decentralization that allows for many communities to talk instead of just one. The goal of the Medium Mastodon instance is to act as a valuable home base for many people, while also helping to boost smart information and ideas. Medium will start inviting select authors and publications to join shortly, and this additional service will be available within their membership. The benefits of this integration include a reliable infrastructure, moderation, short domain names, and interesting local feeds. However, Medium also recognizes that joining the existing Mastodon ecosystem may require a learning curve, particularly with respect to community norms, and wants to ensure that the platform fosters a healthy community.
