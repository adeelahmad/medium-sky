SUMMARY= Two Christian-oriented Super Bowl commercials created a firestorm of controversy, prompting social media outbursts and opposition from people with opposing viewpoints. The ads, which aimed to provide a direct teaching on Jesus' challenges to his disciples to be childlike and to love their enemies, ignited a debate about the use of such commercial tactics to promote Christianity, with some claiming the ads woke those who are ideologically opposed to Jesus' teachings. The ads engaged various people with differing ideologies and political opinions, making it challenging to get ahead, even though the ads' central message was one of love and mercy. Many people have indeed weaponized the teachings of Jesus for their own purposes, using him as a means to coerce others to accept their social and political beliefs. However, at its core, the message of Jesus is about care and love for the marginalized, which requires a radical departure from our self-centered norms and societal expectations.
